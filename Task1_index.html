    <h1>India-Pakistan Tensions in 2025</h1>
    <p>India and Pakistan, two neighboring nations in South Asia, have a long history of conflicts rooted in political, territorial, and religious differences. One of the most sensitive issues remains the status of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
    <p>In 2025, both countries continue to monitor the Line of Control (LoC) closely. Occasional border incidents are reported, but both governments are avoiding full-scale military escalation. Diplomatic ties remain cold, with very limited official communication between the two nations.</p>
    <p>Peace efforts have been discussed in international forums, but deep mistrust and national interests have stalled meaningful progress. Citizens from both sides have expressed a desire for stability and development instead of conflict.</p>
    <p>Security forces in the region are on high alert, and media coverage of even minor events often adds to the tension. Despite these challenges, organizations and youth groups in both countries continue to call for peace, understanding, and cross-border cooperation in humanitarian efforts.</p>
    <h2>Current Situation Summary</h2>

        <li>No major war, but tensions remain high.</li>
