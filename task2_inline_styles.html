    <h1 style="color: #010f13; text-align: center; font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: bold;">India-Pakistan Tensions in 2025</h1>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000000;">
    <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">India and Pakistan, two neighboring nuclear-armed nations, have had a strained relationship since their partition in 1947. A major point of contention continues to be the status of Jammu and Kashmir, a region claimed by both sides but administered separately.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">In 2025, the situation remains tense but controlled. The Line of Control (LoC) is heavily patrolled, and occasional ceasefire violations are reported, especially in the border districts. While no major war has erupted, military preparedness is high on both sides.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Political dialogue has come to a halt. Although international bodies like the UN and several peace advocacy organizations have urged both nations to resume talks, domestic political pressures have made diplomatic efforts difficult. Both sides continue to engage in blame games through media statements and strategic posturing.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Citizens, particularly youth and civil society groups, are increasingly vocal about their desire for peace. Online campaigns, academic collaborations, and humanitarian initiatives have gained popularity despite strict visa restrictions and surveillance. Cross-border cultural exchanges, although limited, show potential for rebuilding trust in the future.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Economically, both countries are focusing on internal development, but defense expenditures remain high. Some analysts warn that this prolonged hostility diverts resources away from education, health, and infrastructure, which are more crucial for long-term growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #2c3e50;">
    <h2 style="color: #010f13; font-size: 2rem;">Current Situation</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">No full-scale war, but persistent tensions along the LoC.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Frequent but controlled border skirmishes.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">No ongoing diplomatic dialogues between the two governments.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Increased calls for peace from youth and civil society groups.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Heavy military presence continues in sensitive regions.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #9a0303;">Peace talks urged by international organizations but remain stalled.</li>
    </ul>
